Atom Editor and LaTeX
======
As I mentioned in other post, Atom editor is a general purpose text editor. We can even write some text in LateX with it. In this post, I will show the first configuration that I made just after install Atom to start to write something in LaTeX

Installing Atom's packages and others configurations
------
I used to write LaTeX documents in the classic LaTeX editors available on the web, like: TeXMaker, TeXstudio, LyX, etc. Later, I moved to web editors, like Overleaf or ShareLatex. However, this last ones merged into a single web editor: Overleafv2. This new version of Overleaf comes with git's features. Therefore, we can use our favorite git editors (like Atom) to modify the Overleaf's documents. 

The most used package for LaTeX writing is the [latex](https://atom.io/packages/latex) package

Some recommended options of this package is: _Build on Save_ and _SyncTeX_. Sometimes _latexmk_ gives some problems, but we can switch to _DiCy_.

For a pdf preview on Atom, we can install the [pdf-view]((https://atom.io/packages/pdf-view) package.

The most important tool to write python code is the [autocomplete-python](https://atom.io/packages/autocomplete-python "autocomplete-python")

A useful package is [file-icons](https://atom.io/packages/file-icons "file-icons"). This package shows a custom icon for each file type.

For a quick way to move over whole code, we install [minimap](https://atom.io/packages/minimap "minimap") package.

I like to install a style guide package for my python codes. I prefer the PEP8 style over others styles. The corresponding atom package is [python-autopep8](https://atom.io/packages/python-autopep8 "python-autopep8")

<img src='/images/6_python_post.png'>

To use this package, we need to install the autopep8 python library. We could install it with `pip install autopep8`. I install it with `apt install python-autopep8`
We could configurate some options, like keybindings.

Finally, I install the [linter-flake8](https://atom.io/packages/linter-flake8 "linter-flake8") package. Flake8 is a tool for style guide enforcement. This package will indicate if there exists a syntactic error in our codes.

Normally, we need install some dependencies.

Also, we have to install the flake8 python package. It could be installed with `pip install flake8`. I install it with `apt install flake8`

We restart Atom and that's all. We are ready to write python codes with Atom.
