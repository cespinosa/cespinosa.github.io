Atom Editor and LaTeX
======
As I mentioned in other post, Atom editor is a general purpose text editor. We can even write some text in LateX with it. In this post, I will show the first configuration that I made just after install Atom to start to write something in LaTeX

Installing Atom's packages and others configurations
------
I used to write LaTeX documents in the classic LaTeX editors available on the web, like: TeXMaker, TeXstudio, LyX, etc. Later, I moved to web editors, like Overleaf or ShareLatex. However, this last ones merged into a single web editor: Overleafv2. This new version of Overleaf comes with git's features. Therefore, we can use our favorite git editors (like Atom) to modify the Overleaf's documents. 

The most used package for LaTeX writing is the [latex](https://atom.io/packages/latex) package

Some recommended options of this package is: _Build on Save_ and _SyncTeX_. Sometimes _latexmk_ gives some problems, but we can switch to _DiCy_.

For a pdf preview on Atom, we can install the [pdf-view](https://atom.io/packages/pdf-view) package.

Make sure that _Auto reload on update_ option is enabled.

A good spelling correction package is the [spell-check](https://atom.io/packages/spell-check). It's possible that this package is already installed (comes with the atom's default packages).

By default, the _spell check_ doesn't work with latex files. This package only checks in specific scopes defined in the package's settings. To make this package check the latex files, we need to add _text.tex.latex_ to the scopes list in the package's configuration.

To get a nice sintax highlighting, we install the [language-latex](https://atom.io/packages/language-latex) package.

Finally, a pleasant theme to a really nice writing experience is [Pen Paper coffee](https://atom.io/themes/pen-paper-coffee-syntax) theme.

And that's all, folks!
