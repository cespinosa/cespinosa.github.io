Atom Editor
======
Atom editor is a general purpose text editor. We can write a code in any programming language with it. In this post, I will show the first configuration that I made just after install Atom to work with python.

Installing Atom's packages and others configuration
------
I always run my codes on terminal (IPython), so, this guide does not include any package to run script on Atom.

The first feature a I like activate is _Scroll Past End_

The second one is _Indent Guide_

The most important tool to write python code is the [autocomplete-python](https://atom.io/packages/autocomplete-python "autocomplete-python")

A useful package is [file-icons](https://atom.io/packages/file-icons "file-icons"). This package shows a custom icon for each file type.

For a quick way to move over whole code is with [minimap](https://atom.io/packages/minimap "minimap") package.

I like install a style guide package for my python codes. I prefer the PEP8 style over others styles. The corresponding atom package is [python-autopep8](https://atom.io/packages/python-autopep8 "python-autopep8")
<img src='/images/6_python_post.png'>
To use this package, we need to install the autopep8 python library. We could install it with `pip install autopep8`. I install it with `apt install python-autopep8`
We could configurate some option, like keybindings.

Finally, I install the [linter-flake8](https://atom.io/packages/linter-flake8 "linter-flake8") package. Flake8 is a tool for style guide enforcement. This package will indicate if there exists a syntactic error in our codes.

Normally, we need install some dependencies.

<img src='/images/10_python_post.png'>
<img src='/images/11_python_post.png'>
Also, we have to install the flake8 python package. It could be installed with `pip install flake8`. I install it with `apt install flake8`
We restart Atom and that's all. We are ready to write python codes with Atom.
