Atom Editor
======
Atom editor is a general purpose text editor. We can write a code in any programming language with it. In this post, I will show the first configuration that I made just after install Atom to work with python.

Installing Atom's packages
------
I always run my codes on terminal (IPython), so, this guide does not include any package to run script on Atom.
