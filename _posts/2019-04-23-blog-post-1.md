Atom Editor
======
Atom editor is a general purpose text editor. We can write a code in any programming language with it. In this post, I will show the first configuration that I made just after install Atom to work with python.

Installing Atom's packages and others configuration
------
I always run my codes on terminal (IPython), so, this guide does not include any package to run script on Atom.

The first feature a I like activate is _Scroll Past End_

The second one is _Indent Guide_

The most important tool to write python code is the [autocomplete-python](https://atom.io/packages/autocomplete-python "autocomplete-python")

A useful package is [file-icons](https://atom.io/packages/file-icons "file-icons"). This package shows a custom icon for each file type.

For a quick way to move over whole code is with [minimap](https://atom.io/packages/minimap "minimap") package.
