Installing GNU Emacs 26 
======
I switched to GNU Emacs instead of Atom. I just found that Emacs configurations is pretty hard. 
I will post my own configuration emacs file later. Today, I figure out that Emacs 26 was released recently. 
However, it's not available in the Linux mint repositories yet. But, I just find out how to install Emacs 26 and, hence, 
this is going to be the topic of this post.

Add PPA repository
------
First, we have to add PPA repository to our system:
<p>
 <code>sudo add-apt-repository ppa:kelleyk/emacs</code> 
</p>

Install GNU Emacs 26
------
We can install Emacs 26  via Synaptic package manager:

<p>
<code>sudo apt update</code>
</p>

<p>
<code>sudo apt install emacs26</code>
</p>

If you want only the text-only interface, replace <code>emacs26</code> with <code>emacs26-nox</code> in the last command. For Ubuntu 18.04 and higher can skip the <code>apt update</code> command.

How to Remove
------
To remove Emacs26, open terminal and run commands:
<p>
<code>sudo apt remove --autoremove emacs26 emacs 26-nox</code>
</p>
Finally, the PPA can be removed by going to <b>Software & Update -> Other Software </b> tab.
