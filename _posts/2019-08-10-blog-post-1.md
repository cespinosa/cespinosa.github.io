Installing GNU Emacs 26 
======
I switched to GNU Emacs instead of Atom. I just found that Emacs configurations is pretty hard. 
I will post my own configuration emacs file later. Today, I figure out that Emacs 26 was released recently. 
However, it's not available in the Linux mint repositories yet. But, I just find out how to install Emacs 26 and, hence, 
this is going to be the topic of this post.
