Git is a great tools for developing and even write papers.
On the web, many tools to work with online git repository are availables, like GitHub or GitLab.
However, if we want to work with the files locally in our PC and then upload it to Github or another services,
we must to configure our local git.

The local configuration it's very well explained on github, but I write here the step that I always do.
